- **Book a Session**: Clients can book a session by selecting a package, duration, and session type (call, video, or in-person).
- **Employer Coverage**: Option to apply employer-provided discounts, reducing session costs if applicable.
- **Payment Integration**: Easy-to-use payment system for booking sessions.
- **Email Notifications**: Clients receive email confirmations with session details and reminders.
- **Rescheduling & Cancellations**: Clients can reschedule or cancel sessions within the therapist's allowed timeframe.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js (React-based framework)
- **Backend**: Node.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (with Prisma ORM)
- **Email Service**: Integrated email notifications for session reminders and updates
- **CSS**: Tailwind CSS for styling and responsiveness

## Installation

Follow the steps below to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
2. **MongoDB Atlas Account** or a local MongoDB server
3. **Prisma CLI** (installed globally)

### Steps

   ```

   Replace `<username>` and `<password>` with your actual MongoDB credentials.

5. Generate the Prisma client:
